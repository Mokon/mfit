Mokon Fitness

This program takes a xml file with a bunch of statistics about your health and
then computes a bunch of additional statistics based on those. I have my config
file in cfg/config.xml. Edit that with yours. If you don't know some of your
stats just delete that line from the xml file. This program is smart enough to
handle missing stats. It will only compute stats when it is able to given what
you provide. It will compute the maximum set of those statistics.

To build;
  ./bootstrap && ./configure --disable-debug && make && sudo make install
To clean:
  make clean && make clean-purge

There are several prerequisites that must be installed. These include the
autotools build programs. If you are a fedora/rh user try:
  sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
You will also need the devel packages for the following libs installed:
  glog
  boost_system
  boost_program_options
  boost_filesystem
  pugixml

Please note this program was mainly designed to be extendable. Much of the
design choices are slow (e.g. never caching values on parsing). This was a
design choice for simplicity as this program runs plenty fast enough as it
stands currently.
